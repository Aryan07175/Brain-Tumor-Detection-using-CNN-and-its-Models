# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning

🎉 I  did it (somehow 😄)
Late-night struggles, days of testing and training, hours of laughter, confusion, and countless sleepless nights — this project has been a wild ride!

 set out to build a deep learning model that could classify brain tumors from MRI scans.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project explores the use of deep learning for classifying brain tumors using MRI scans. Our aim is to contribute towards AI tools that can assist doctors in diagnosing brain tumors more effectively.

### ✅ Key Highlights:
- 📊 Dataset: Preprocessed and cleaned a challenging MRI image dataset.
- 🧠 Models Implemented:
  - Custom **CNN** (Accuracy: ~88%)
  - **VGG16** (Accuracy: ~94%)
  - **ResNet50** (Accuracy: ~98%) — *Best performer!*
- 🔄 Training involved:
  - Handling class imbalances
  - Augmentation & normalization
  - Managing epochs, overfitting, and long training times

## 📈 Results

| Model     | Accuracy |
|-----------|----------|
| ResNet50  | ~98%     |
| VGG16     | ~94%     |
| Custom CNN| ~88%     |

Each model had its strengths and taught us different lessons in architecture design and training optimization.
